EasyHPC is an thorough documentation whose purpose is to allow anyone to **collaborate on High Performance Computing (HPC) projects**.
HPC requires mastering a wide range of independent fields (see items below). 

Nonetheless, nothing is impossible, do not discourage yourself! 

If you follow the guidelines, you will grasp the main concepts to run HPC experiments, especially for Deep Learning (DL) purposes. 

EasyHPC intended to boost the learning process by providing condensend information that encompasses the knowledge of several months. It comes with self-explanatory materials and generic commands. 

EasyHPC includes:

    -  Github usage
    -  Collaborative code development
    -  CI/CD
    -  System Administration
    -  Docker
    -  HPC
    -  GPU Computing
    -  Deep Learning
    -  Physics-informed Neural Networks

This code was created for an Undergraduate research course at Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez, Santiago, Chile.
